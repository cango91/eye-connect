# eyeConnect

eyeConnect is a telemedicine application specifically developed with a focus on ophthalmology, designed to facilitate asynchronous communication and collaboration between volunteer healthcare providers and ophthalmology specialists. The main aim of eyeConnect is to combat preventable blindness due to retinopathy, which is a common issue in underdeveloped regions. This is achieved through the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using funduscopy.

**The ultimate goal is to significantly reduce the instances of preventable blindness across the globe.**
