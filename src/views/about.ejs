      <p>eyeConnect is a telemedicine application specifically developed with a focus on ophthalmology, designed to facilitate asynchronous communication and collaboration between volunteer healthcare providers and ophthalmology specialists. The main aim of eyeConnect is to combat preventable blindness due to retinopathy, which is a common issue in underdeveloped regions. This is achieved through the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using funduscopy.</p>
      <p>In its operation, the platform enables healthcare volunteers in remote areas to upload fundus images, or retinal scans, onto the platform. Ophthalmology specialists from around the world can then log in at their convenience, view these images, and provide their expertise by adding consultation notes to each image. These consultative notes assist field doctors in confirming or revising their initial assessments and deciding the best course of action for the patient.</p>

      <p>To assist field doctors with initial diagnoses, eyeConnect incorporates an automated image classification tool. This feature provides a first line categorization of the fundus images based on its recognition algorithms. However, it is crucial to understand that this is a supportive feature, and it is recommended that all diagnoses are confirmed by ophthalmology specialists who use the platform.</p>
      <p>Notifications are a vital part of this asynchronous process. When an ophthalmology specialist provides a consultation note for an uploaded fundus image, the field doctor who uploaded the image is notified. This way, even though the process isn't happening in real-time, the system ensures timely updates and continuous information flow.</p>
      <p>By facilitating this seamless connection and knowledge exchange between healthcare providers and ophthalmology specialists, eyeConnect aims to help mitigate the lack of specialized eye care resources in underdeveloped regions. The ultimate goal is to significantly reduce the instances of preventable blindness across the globe.</p>
