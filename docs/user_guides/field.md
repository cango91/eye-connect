Similarly all three of the following controls will lead to `Examinations` page where you can view all examinations submitted by field HCPs:

Clicking on any row under `My Recent Patients` table will take you to that patient's details page, where you can view patient info and all examinations of the patient listed. Whereas clicking the blue notes button (![new exam icon](./images/notes_btn.png)) will start a new exam for that patient.

Similarly, clicking on any row under `My Recent Exams` table will take you to that exam's details page where you can edit your notes, upload new funduscopy images, view consultation (if any) or delete the examination. The trash icon (![trash icon](./images/trash_btn.png)) provides a shortcut for deleting the exam in that row.

To the right side of the navigation bar, you will notice a bell icon. These are your notifications. When you have a new notification, a badge with the number of new notifications will appear.

### Patient Details

![patient details page](./images/field_13.png)
**View and edit patient details**

In this page you will see basic information of patient, as well as a complete list of their previous exams in the system (not just your own examinations of the patient). The trash icon (![trash icon](./images/trash_btn.png)) provides a shortcut to delete your exams (you can only delete exams that you have created). Clicking on any exam from the table will take you to exam details page. If it is your own exam, you will be able to edit the exam.

The edit icon (![edit icon](./images/edit_btn.png)) will make the patient demographics (name, sex and date of birth) editable and turn into a checkmark (![check icon](./images/check_btn.png)). Click the checkmark after making any changes to persist them. Clicking the notes icon (![notes icon](./images/notes_btn.png)) will begin a new exam for the patient.

## Exams
### New Exam
![new exam page](./images/field_14.png)

When you begin a new exam, (you may briefly see a loading page) an empty exam for the patient under your name will be created, and you will be presented with a simple UI with an area for your exam notes, patient's demographics information and an area for image uploads. Your navbar will also update to indicate you are currently editing an exam. 

![navbar update-exam](./images/field_15.png)

<blockquote>
Notice that even though you have just started a new examination, navbar will say `Update Exam`. That is because once you click new exam in anywhere in the app, an empty exam will be created. If you had not intended to create an exam at this point, please make sure to use the trash icon (![trash icon](./images/trash_btn.png)) to delete the exam record.
